## Goal

I have a JavaScript background (both frontend and NodeJS). I started go a few weeks ago (really enjoy it - just like a NodeJS with pointers and threads ðŸ˜œ).

For my first side project in Go, I decided to make a video game, since I think it's a [very good way](http://dev.topheman.com/my-projects/) to get into a new programming language.

The [Youtube Videos tutorial JustForFunc](https://youtu.be/aYkxFbd6luY?list=PL64wiCrrxh4Jisi7OcCJIUpguV_f5jGnZ) by [Francesc Campoy](https://github.com/campoy) were a great resource.

At the end, the development only took me a few days whereas the [packaging / build part](#build) took me a lot of time (and is still in progress) ... For this part, I must thank [veeableful](https://github.com/veeableful) for her help [on this issue](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/issues/234).

If you feel like to help, please take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/issues).

## Install

You need to install first SDL2 and the SDL2 bindings for Go.

### Install SDL2

You need to install first SDL2 and the SDL2 bindings for Go. To do so, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2).
It is quite easy to install on basically any platform.

You will also need to install [pkg-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config).

Example (on Mac OS X - with `pkg-config` already present):

```shell
$ which pkg-config
/usr/local/bin/pkg-config
$ brew install sdl2
$ brew install sdl2_image
$ brew install sdl2_ttf
$ brew install sdl2_mixer
$ go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl
$ go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/mix
$ go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/img
$ go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/ttf
```

## Development

You can build a dev version of the game via a simple `go build`.

You can also create the same build via `make darwin-dev` (same as `go build`, though it will name the binary `gopher-ball.app`, so that when you open it from the finder it doesn't open a terminal first).

## Build

### TLDR;

This part is still in progress (for the moment, only MacOS packaging is supported).

* `make darwin`: will create a bundle for MacOS, in the `./dist` folder
* `make clean`: cleans up the `./dist` folder
* `make` (alias of `make help`): prints out the documentation of the [Makefile](https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/blob/master/Makefile) 

### Explanation

There were a lot of apps made in golang with sdl2 (or other golang bridge with c) but none of them implement a **release step** (generate a standalone binary that you could share).

Since, there are C libraries involved, it implies that you link them in some way in the bundle you will generate. Here is my solution (please share yours):

#### On MacOS:

* Create a bundle with the same folder structure as any MacOS `.app`
* Identify the specific shared libraries (the ones under `/user/local`) using `otool -L <binary_name>` (same as Linux's `ldd`)
* Repeat previous step on each libraries (to identify the links between nested libraries)
* Copy those libraries to the bundle inside `Contents/Frameworks`
* Link the root libraries (the one required by the binary) with `install_name_tool -change <lib_name> @executable_path/../Frameworks/<lib_name> <binary_name>`
* Link the nested libraries with `install_name_tool -change <lib_name> @executable_path/../Frameworks/<lib_name> <parent_lib_name>`

**Checkout the [Makefile](https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/blob/master/Makefile)** for the whole build steps.

Note: Some part of that could be automated via some recursive script - [here is a start](https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/blob/master/bin/otool_list.sh).
