## Goal

I have a JavaScript background (both frontend and NodeJS). I started go a few weeks ago (really enjoy it - just like a NodeJS with pointers and threads ðŸ˜œ).

I needed some project to test on. For the last years, I made a few [video games in JavaScript](http://dev.topheman.com/my-projects/) and I think it's a good way to learn a new programming language (some people will tell that it's a little weird to learn go that way which might be more server/data oriented).

Anyway here is my first golang project. I must thank [Francesc Campoy](https://github.com/campoy) for his great [Youtube Videos JustForFunc](https://youtu.be/aYkxFbd6luY?list=PL64wiCrrxh4Jisi7OcCJIUpguV_f5jGnZ).

As you will see, **this is still a work in progress**. If some of you have infos about the build part, please share them via the [issues](https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/issues), [twitter](https://twitter.com/topheman) or any other way ...

## Install

You need to install first SDL2 and the SDL2 bindings for Go.

### Install SDL2

You need to install first SDL2 and the SDL2 bindings for Go. To do so, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2).
It is quite easy to install on basically any platform.

You will also need to install [pkg-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config).

Example (on Mac OS X - with `pkg-config` already present):

```shell
$ which pkg-config
/usr/local/bin/pkg-config
$ brew install sdl2
$ brew install sdl2_image
$ brew install sdl2_ttf
$ brew install sdl2_mixer
$ go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl
$ go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/mix
$ go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/img
$ go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/ttf
```

## Development

You can build a dev version of the game via a simple `go build`.

You can also create the same build via `make darwin-dev` (same as `go build`, though it will name the binary `gopher-ball.app`, so that when you open it from the finder it doesn't open a terminal first).

## Build

### TLDR;

This part is still in progress (for the moment, only MacOS packaging is supported).

* `make darwin`: will create a bundle for MacOS, in the `./dist` folder
* `make clean`: cleans up the `./dist` folder
* `make` (alias of `make help`): prints out the documentation of the [Makefile](https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/blob/master/Makefile) 

### Explanation

There were a lot of apps made in golang with sdl2 (or other golang bridge with c) but none of them implement a **release step** (generate a standalone binary that you could share).

Since, there are C libraries involved, it implies that you link them in some way in the bundle you will generate.

Here is my solution (please share yours):

#### On MacOS:

I create a bundle with the same folder structure as any MacOS `.app`. Then I copy copy the shared libraries of SDL2 to `Contents/Frameworks` and link them via `install_name_tool`.

Some infos:

* To list the libs used by your binary: `otool -L <binary_name>` (same as Linux's `ldd`)
* To link those libraries, use `install_name_tool -change <lib_name> @executable_path/../Frameworks/<lib_name> <binary_name>`

Checkout the [Makefile](https://github.com/topheman/gopher-ball/blob/master/Makefile) for the whole build steps.
